# Facebook OAuth Multi-User Setup ✅

## System Overview
Your application now supports **multi-user Facebook authentication** where each user logs in with their own Facebook account and manages their own ad campaigns.

## How It Works

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
```
User → Your App → Facebook OAuth → User's Facebook Account
                        ↓
            User grants permissions to YOUR app
                        ↓
            User selects their ad account & page
                        ↓
            User creates campaigns in THEIR account
```

### 2. **Key Components**

#### **Your Facebook App (Gateway)**
- App ID: `1013938650474901`
- App Secret: `66d1b486aba35c2ede0b5b32f699dc9a`
- Status: **Live Mode** (ready for public use)
- Purpose: Acts as the gateway for users to authenticate

#### **User Authentication**
- Each user logs in with THEIR Facebook account
- Their access token is encrypted and stored securely
- They can only access their own ad accounts

#### **Resource Selection**
- Users select which of their ad accounts to use
- Users select which Facebook page to use
- Optional: Select pixel for tracking
- Storage preference: Local (persistent) or Session (temporary)

### 3. **Security Features**
- ✅ No hardcoded user tokens
- ✅ User tokens encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- ✅ Users isolated from each other
- ✅ Eligibility verification before campaign creation
- ✅ Audit logging for all actions

## User Experience

### First Time Setup:
1. User creates account in your app
2. Clicks "Connect with Facebook"
3. Logs in to THEIR Facebook account
4. Grants permissions to your app
5. Selects their ad account and page
6. Chooses storage preference
7. Ready to create campaigns

### Returning Users:
- **Local Storage**: Automatically reconnected
- **Session Storage**: Need to reconnect each session

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes:
- `FacebookAuth` model with user-specific tokens
- Resource selection endpoints (`/api/auth/facebook/resources`)
- Campaign creation uses user's selected accounts
- Eligibility verification system

### Frontend Changes:
- `FacebookAuth.tsx` - Main authentication component
- `FacebookAccountSelector.tsx` - Resource selection UI
- `localStorageAuth.ts` - Token persistence service

### Database Schema:
```sql
facebook_auth table:
- user_id (links to user)
- access_token (encrypted)
- selected_ad_account (JSON)
- selected_page (JSON)
- selected_pixel (JSON)
- storage_preference (local/session)
```

## Testing the System

### Quick Test:
```bash
# Backend test
node test-multi-user-flow.js

# Full test
1. Login to http://localhost:3000
2. Use admin@example.com / admin123456
3. Click "Connect with Facebook"
4. Authenticate with Facebook
5. Select ad account and page
6. Create a test campaign
```

## Important URLs

### Facebook Developer Dashboard:
- App Settings: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1013938650474901/settings/basic/
- Facebook Login Settings: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1013938650474901/fb-login/settings/

### OAuth Redirect URI:
- Development: `http://localhost:5002/api/auth/facebook/callback`
- Production: Update to your production URL

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid App ID" Error:
- Check FB_APP_SECRET is correct (32 hex characters)
- Verify OAuth redirect URI matches exactly

### Database Errors:
```bash
# Update schema if needed
node scripts/update-facebook-auth-table.js
```

### Port Issues:
```bash
# Kill process on port 5002
lsof -ti:5002 | xargs kill -9
```

## Benefits of This Setup

1. **Scalability**: No need to manage individual user tokens
2. **Security**: Users can't access other users' accounts
3. **Compliance**: Follows Facebook's OAuth best practices
4. **User Control**: Users manage their own authentication
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Each user pays for their own ads

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**:
   - Update redirect URI to production URL
   - Use secure HTTPS endpoints
   - Set proper CORS headers

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Token refresh automation
   - Multiple ad account support per user
   - Campaign performance tracking

## Status: ✅ READY FOR USE

The system is fully configured and operational. Users can now:
- Authenticate with their own Facebook accounts
- Select their ad accounts and pages
- Create campaigns in their own accounts
- Have their credentials securely stored
